title: About Me
---

Welcome to my site.

My name is Juan A. Rubio and I am a Software Contractor specialised in C/C++
development in telephony, mobile and embedded software environments. Over the
years I have also developed an expertise in multimedia frameworks and audio/video
hardware acceleration APIs. With a keen interest in Linux as a platform and
Open Source technologies in general.

I live in the UK with my wife and my three children and I work as a Software
Consultant through my company, Aratelia Limited. In the past I have worked
for software houses like Vodafone, Lucent Technologies, Ericsson, Symbian,
Nokia, ip.access Limited and nowdays Videojet Techonologies.

My main hobby are my kids and when I have some spare time, I like to to spend
some of it with my Yamaha S90ES. When I can, I put some time on an open source
project called Tizonia, a cloud music player for the Linux terminal and an Open
Source implementation of the OpenMAX IL 1.2 specification by The Khronos Group.

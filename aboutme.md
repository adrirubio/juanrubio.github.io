title: About Me
---

Welcome to my site.

My name is Juan A. Rubio and I am an experienced Software Consultant
specialised in C and C++ development. Over the years I have worked in
telecommunications, mobile and embedded software development environments. I am
a passionate Open Source advocate and Linux enthusiast. Next to my love for
telecomms and Linux, another area of keen interest for me is multimedia
frameworks and audio/video hardware-accelerated APIs.

I live in the UK and I work as a Software Consultant through my own company,
[Aratelia Limited](http://aratelia.com/). In the past I have worked for
companies like Vodafone, Lucent Technologies, Ericsson,
[Symbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian_Ltd.), Nokia,
[ip.access](http://www.ipaccess.com/) and [Videojet
Techonologies](http://www.videojet.co.uk/).

Out of work, my main occupation these days is my wife and children. When I have
some time, I try to practice some sport (mostly running, gym or basketball) and
be a (shadow) piano teacher to my children. I also put time on an Open Source
project called [Tizonia](http://tizonia.org), a cloud music player for the
Linux console and the first Open Source implementation of the [OpenMAX IL 1.2
specification](https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-group-releases-openmax-il-1.2-provisional-specification)
by [The Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/).

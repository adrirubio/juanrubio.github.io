For some time now, I wanted to have a blog. Now, I&#8217;ve got it. My <a title="About" href="http://www.juanrubio.me/?page_id=2" target="_blank">weblog/wiki</a> is now up and running. Piece of cake&#8230;.well&#8230; almost&#8230; :-). It takes some time to put all the pieces together, let&#8217;s recap:

  * **_finding a web hosting solution that&#8217;s best suited for your style and/or needs_**: 
      * Being a software developer,  I&#8217;ve chosen an unmanaged <a title="Wikipedia:VPS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server" target="_blank">VPS</a> webhosting solution, very common these days. I was initially undecided between <a title="www.slicehost.com/" href="http://www.slicehost.com/" target="_blank">Slicehost</a> and <a title="www.linode.com/" href="http://www.linode.com" target="_blank">Linode</a>. They both seemed to be very similar services offering almost identical solutions. I&#8217;ve finally gone with Linode for two simple reasons: Linode is a bit cheaper and they have <a title="linode-expands-into-europe" href="http://blog.linode.com/2009/12/07/linode-expands-into-europe/" target="_blank">UK-based data center</a> (but I kinda like the Slicehost documentation a bit better).
  * **_selecting an open source_** [**_CMS_**:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system "Wikipedia:Content_management_system") 
      * Deciding the CMS, the main three alternatives for me (and seemingly for most people out there) were: <a title="http://wordpress.org/" href="http://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, <a title="http://drupal.org/" href="http://drupal.org/" target="_blank">Drupal</a> and [Joomla!](http://www.joomla.org/ "http://www.joomla.org/"). Well, for blogging purposes, WordPress is an obvious choice. So I went with WordPress.
      * Actually, there was another contender, <a title="http://ikiwiki.info/" href="http://ikiwiki.info/" target="_blank">IkiWiki</a>. With IkiWiki you can also create a weblog in no time at all. As a blogging tool, it is a much more minimalistic solution, but I had already decided to go with WordPress as I wanted to have greater flexibility in terms of templating and visual appearance.
      * Finally, I decided to go with Joomla! for my company&#8217;s website. In terms of user friendliness/easy of configuration vs power, Joomla! is perhaps half-way through between WordPress and Drupal, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting to require a lot of customization for my company&#8217;s web site, so Joomla! seemed like a good compromise.
  * **_choosing a wiki technology_**: 
      * For many years I&#8217;ve been using internal wikis in different corporate environments to record all sorts of work-related information. As many people, I&#8217;ve had that love-hate relationship with most of the wikis I&#8217;ve found, but in the end I&#8217;ve learnt to like them. So I also wanted to have my own wiki in my site. After having a look at <a title="http://www.wikimatrix.org/" href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/" target="_blank">Wikimatrix</a>, I was amazed to discover how many different wiki technologies are out there. A wiki is an easy tool to record and format the various Internet resources, cheat sheets, reference cards, code snippets, and millions of small pieces of information that a software developer normally keeps somewhere at hand for &#8220;future reference&#8221;. For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been doing that with Emacs and <a title="http://orgmode.org/" href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">org-mode</a>. Which I still continue to use, but when I discovered that I could [use IkiWiki and org-mode](http://www.golden-gryphon.com/blog/manoj/blog/2008/06/08/Using_org-mode_with_Ikiwiki/ "Using org-mode with Ikiwiki"), I decided that I had to have <a title="http://www.juanrubio.me/wiki/" href="http://www.juanrubio.me/wiki/" target="_blank">my own IkiWiki</a> in my site.

OK, so now we&#8217;ve got the decision about the web hosting, the CMS and the wiki, now one only has to set up everything!&#8230; But more about that in a Second Post..

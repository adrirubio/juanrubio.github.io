An article about Tizonia has been featured this week in the online open-source news site [OMG! Ubuntu!](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/).

Here is the article:

OMG! Ubuntu! is a very well-known blog specialised in the Ubuntu Linux
distribution and [one of the main online sources for Ubuntu-related
news](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMG!_Ubuntu!). OMG! Ubuntu! was launched in
2009 by [Joey-Elijah
Sneddon](https://www.ubuntu-user.com/Magazine/Archive/2013/16/OMG!-Ubuntu) who still runs it.

Overall, a very positive review in this article by Joey-Elijah and some good
feedback too by the users in the comments section. The article has driven lots
of new users to the Tizonia website and GitHub page. Nice to see that users
like the idea of driving their cloud music sources with a simple command-line!.
